# CPE Manager

Very simple CPE manager mostly aimed to Chinese brands (like VSOL), to allow making changes using HTTP, such as getting DHCP clients, Active Wifi users or changing the SSID and Password of the WIFI network.

Usually those CPEs don't have any reliable TR069 implementation and/or lack SSH, hence why it is done using HTTP and scrapping.
